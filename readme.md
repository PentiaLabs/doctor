## Usage

Will eventually be build into [FrontendBuilder](https://github.com/PentiaLabs/FrontendBuilder):

Until then it's in a state of development, and should be used in conjunction with [npm-link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link)

Can also be run with `ptdoctor` if installed globally (or if it has been npm linked)
